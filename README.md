Hi, I'm Himanshi Rangwani

I'm a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student (3rd year) with a focused interest in Data Science, Python-based backend development, and practical problem-solving through real projects.

I believe in learning by building. Most of my work revolves around analyzing data, designing backend systems, and turning ideas into functional applications rather than just completing tutorials.
